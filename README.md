# SIEM-FOR-SMALL-BUSINESS
üõ°Ô∏è Lightweight SIEM Solution for Small Businesses
This project demonstrates how to build a lightweight Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system tailored for small business environments. The setup includes a Windows machine acting as the business server and an Ubuntu machine serving as the SIEM server. Using Splunk as the SIEM platform and Windows Universal Forwarder for log forwarding, this project showcases a practical, cost-effective solution for centralized log collection, event correlation, and basic threat detection.

üîß Technologies Used
SIEM Platform: Splunk (Free Tier)

Log Forwarder: Windows Universal Forwarder

Operating Systems: Windows (Business Server), Ubuntu (SIEM Server)

üß† Project Focus
This project falls under the domain of Cybersecurity, with an emphasis on:

Centralized log monitoring

Real-time security event analysis

Improved incident detection for small business IT environments

üìò Key Concepts
SIEM: Monitors and analyzes security data from multiple sources in real time.

Log Collection: Collects logs from endpoints and servers for analysis.

Event Correlation: Identifies suspicious behavior by correlating multiple events.

üéØ Project Goal
To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of a lightweight SIEM solution in a small business setting using free and open tools. This setup helps improve security visibility and threat detection without the overhead of enterprise-grade systems.
